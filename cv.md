#### Information About Myself

I started my career and training a year ago. I chose Python as my first programming language. Immediately plunged into this fascinating process. After some time, I moved on to the study JS.
Programming has changed my life a lot. I liked this profession so much that I transferred to another faculty. Now my every day is connected with programming.
I spare no time and effort in my work. I love difficult tasks that require a long solution.
